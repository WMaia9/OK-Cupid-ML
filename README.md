# OK Cupid Michine Learning Project

# Introdution

This project analyzes data from on-line dating application OKCupid. In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that we've never had before about how different people experience romance.


**Data sources:**

`okcupid_profiles.csv` was provided by Kaggle.com: [OkCupid Profiles](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/okcupid-profiles)

### Project Goals

In this project, the goal is analyzes the data from Kaggle using tools of Data Science. The primary research question that will be answered is whether an OkCupid's user astrological sign can be predicted using other variables from their profiles.


### Data

The project has one data set provided by Kaggle called `okcupid_profiles.csv`. In the data, each row represents an OkCupid user and the columns are the responses to their user profiles which include multi-choice and short answer questions.

### Analysis

This solution will use descriptive statistics and data visualization to find key figures in understanding the distribution, count, and relationship between variables. Since the goal of the project to make predictions on the user's astrological signs, classification algorithms from the supervised learning family of machine learning models will be implemented. 

### Evaluation

The project will conclude with the evaluation of the machine learning model selected with a validation data set. The output of the predictions can be checked through a confusion matrix, and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and Kappa scores.
